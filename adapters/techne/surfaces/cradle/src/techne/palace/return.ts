/**
 * Palace Return (L5 Technē M5′, QL-MEF #218) — the Recognition/Return leg
 * that closes the canonical traversal back into M0′ ground.
 *
 * Laws carried here:
 *   - the Return routes a NATIVE owner Action (the reading's disclosed
 *     governed-write action, e.g. the TB0 specimen's `aikit.wiki.stage`);
 *     the adapter routes, the owner executes under its own authority — the
 *     Palace never mutates native state and never simulates a source change
 *     by changing its own décor;
 *   - a proposal the owner refuses (or that is not disclosed) routes to an
 *     explicit unrouted receipt and mutates NOTHING: no reading field, no
 *     composition, no bookmark changes (the rejected leg is provable);
 *   - after an accepted (routed) Return, the renewed ground is re-opened by
 *     crossing to the M0′ project aperture on the same DisclosureSession —
 *     subject, selection basis and agent session ride along untouched;
 *   - no stochastic identity; every input is a pure function of the reading
 *     and the composition.
 *
 * Erasable TypeScript: loadable by the renderer, Vite, and `node --test`.
