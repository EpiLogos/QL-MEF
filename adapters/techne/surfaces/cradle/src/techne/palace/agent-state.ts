/**
 * Palace structured state for the situated agencies (L5 Technē M5′, QL-MEF
 * #218 §9) — the structured description of the current composition that
 * Aletheia_5 / Technē_5 (and Epii, the canonical M5 Guardian) co-reference
 * instead of scraping any DOM or reconstructing UI text.
 *
 * Laws carried here:
 *   - everything returned is either verbatim from the reading (native refs,
 *     actions, agency bindings, provenance) or derived presentation fact of
 *     the composition (regions, placements, bookmarks) — clearly separated;
 *   - unresolved evidence is named, never smoothed over: refs without a
 *     disclosed revision, and subjects without provenance, appear with the
 *     reason they are unresolved (a Recognition target, not a defect to hide);
 *   - no runtime, no session store, no Agent framework: this module is a
 *     pure function over the reading and the composition.
 *
 * Erasable TypeScript: loadable by the renderer, Vite, and `node --test`.
