/**
 * Palace composition state (L5 Technē M5′, QL-MEF #218) — the session-scoped
 * presentation state of the Palace surface: whether the integral composition
 * is bound, each region's arrangement, and the visitor's bookmarks.
 *
 * Laws carried here:
 *   - this is PRESENTATION state of one surface, never semantic data: binding
 *     the composition mutates no reading, mints no native ref, and writes no
 *     store (no localStorage, no IndexedDB, no Palace record). It lives as
 *     long as the desktop session and is re-derived from the reading after a
 *     full restart — re-entry within the session recovers it (the surface's
 *     restart/re-enter continuity); app-restart recovery is a recorded join
     on the owner's presentation-artifact path;
 *   - state is keyed by the reading basis (subject_ref + reading_ref), so
 *     two subjects never share a composition;
 *   - no stochastic identity: keys are derived, never random; every
 *     transition is a pure function of its inputs.
 *
 * Erasable TypeScript: loadable by the renderer, Vite, and `node --test`.
