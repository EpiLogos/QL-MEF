/**
 * The M0′ situated-Agency operating state (L5 Technē, issue #213 §7) — the
 * structured state through which `Aletheia_0 / Technē_0` locates, inspects,
 * traverses, proposes and Returns over the M0′ instrument using native refs.
 *
 * Laws kept here (dual-reading lock §16, #213 §7, TB0-1 role floor):
 *   - an Agency reads THIS state (the contract types and the bounded view),
 *     never the DOM and never a private graph parse;
 *   - the role bindings are the reading's own `agency[]` disclosure — this
 *     module never mints a role, a session ref or a profile ref; when no
 *     Technē_0/Aletheia_0 binding is disclosed, that absence is carried
 *     honestly with its reason;
 *   - locate/traverse are READS over disclosed facts; propose/execute enter
 *     as a TechneActionRoute through the adapter and only the native owner
 *     executes, under its own authority;
 *   - identity (subject, refs, snapshot, actions) is carried verbatim.
 *
 * Pure functions, erasable TypeScript: loadable by the renderer, Vite, and
 * `node --test`.
