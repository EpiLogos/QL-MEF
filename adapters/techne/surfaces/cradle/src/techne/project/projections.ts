/**
 * The M0′ Project / Wiki / Graph projections (L5 Technē, issue #213) — the
 * ONE subject/selection spine over the reading's bounded whole, projected as
 * LIST / TREE / GRAPH. Modelled on AIKit's bounded relation grammar
 * (`RelationQuery` → one `KnowledgeRelationView` shared by the List/Tree/
 * Graph presentation modes): there is no second graph substrate, store or
 * ontology here — every node and edge is the reading's own, refs verbatim.
 *
 * Laws kept here (QL-MEF wayfinder §3–§6, dual-reading lock §6, #213 §4):
 *   - ONE bounded view per query; LIST/TREE/GRAPH are projections of it, so
 *     the same native refs appear in all three and a selection survives a
 *     view switch untouched;
 *   - bounded local whole, never a hairball: expansion from the focus across
 *     the whole's relations within an explicit depth and node/edge budgets
 *     (AIKit parity: depth 1, 96 nodes, 192 edges); truncation and boundary
 *     endpoints are reported, never silently dropped;
 *   - relation vocabulary, standing, identity (relation_ref) and temporal
 *     qualification ride verbatim — nothing is relabelled or inferred;
 *   - semantic zoom is PRESENTATION: a tier narrows what is disclosed of the
 *     already-computed view; it never changes the query (AIKit: "filtering
 *     is presentation, not a second query"). Only an explicit expansion step
 *     (a new depth) is a query change;
 *   - a filesystem path IS a provider view, never the ontology: the tree
 *     projection is the relation spanning-tree from the focus, with members
 *     no relation reaches held under an explicit detached root;
 *   - pure functions, erasable TypeScript: loadable by the renderer, Vite,
 *     and `node --test`.
