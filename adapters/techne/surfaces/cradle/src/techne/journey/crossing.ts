/**
 * The M3′ crossing (L5 Technē T5 — issue #216) — the formal 4:2 ↔ 3:3
 * bridge law, executable. Journey is the hinge: entering a scene crosses the
 * DisclosureSession onto the conjugate 3:3 Expression reading carrying the
 * EXACT scene ref; returning restores the exact Journey position. Locked
 * laws carried in code (dual-reading lock §§12–13, §22; TB0-1 cross-cut
 * identity):
 *
 *   - crossing changes disclosure, never identity: subject, selection,
 *     source/revision basis, agent session and occasion are untouched (the
 *     session store guarantees this; this module guarantees the scene ref
 *     rides the selection verbatim and proves nothing else moved);
 *   - the scene ref rides the selection's own `focus_refs` — the contract's
 *     existing focus field, so no mirror extension and no second channel
 *     exists (the ported TS mirror is at the T0 field set; `scene_focus_ref`
 *     on the canonical TB0-1 session schema is the pinned upstream spelling —
 *     recorded for #212/#219, not privately mirrored here);
 *   - the application cut is DERIVED from the instrument (TB0-1: expressions
 *     ↔ 3:3-conjugate, deep instruments ↔ 4:2-deep) — derived, never stored,
 *     so it cannot drift from the instrument it describes;
 *   - a crossing onto the cut already occupied is refused (TB0-1
 *     `cross_cut` law);
 *   - Return is exact: the beat the focus names is found by scene_ref
 *     equality, never by index guessing.
 *
 * Erasable TypeScript: loadable by the renderer, Vite, and `node --test`.
