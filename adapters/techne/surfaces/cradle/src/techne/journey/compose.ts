/**
 * The Journey's scene composition (L5 Technē T5 — issue #216, §4) —
 * cross-instrument intake as a ROUTED proposal, never a copy.
 *
 * Journey accepts the exact current selection (Project / Canvas / Relation /
 * World selections arrive through the DisclosureSession's own selection) and
 * composes a scene-create proposal over the subject's bound Expression. The
 * proposal carries the selected refs VERBATIM — subject, focus refs, the
 * reading's temporal/place/source facets — and nothing is minted locally
 * except the proposed scene ref, which follows the substrate's own
 * `${expressionRef}:scene:` grammar (the same convention the Expressions
 * bridge's composer uses, src/techne/expressions/cue.ts). A proposed ref that
 * collides with a disclosed scene is refused: Journey proposes new scenes,
 * it never re-orders or re-names the owner's existing ones through this path
 * (reordering is ./sequence's proposal).
 *
 * CT materiality (Vāk lock §4, V1): when the draft binds a C′ content type
 * for the new scene, the proposal must carry the material that CT demands —
 * CT0 relation refs from the whole, CT1 an exact source selector, CT2 a
 * disclosed action ref, CT3 a warranted shape/constellation ref, CT4 a real
 * place or temporal facet, CT5 warranted derivation refs. A proposal lacking
 * its CT's material is refused, never silently stripped of the label.
 *
 * The route names the Expression owner's real edit semantics (the disclosed
 * sequence action, else `oi.expression.edit` — the substrate's
 * ExpressionRequest `edit` with `scene_create` in its Change union); routing
 * resolves it honestly (an undisclosed action comes back unrouted with its
 * reason). The proposal persists nothing.
 *
 * Erasable TypeScript: loadable by the renderer, Vite, and `node --test`.
