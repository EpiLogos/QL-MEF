/**
 * The Journey's C′ compositional binding (L5 Technē T5 — issue #216, §6).
 *
 * Journey CONSUMES the accepted Vāk/C′ vocabulary; it implements no second
 * C′ language. The canonical system: QL-MEF `crates/ql-mef/src/cprime_oikonomia.rs`
 * (accepted #138; CS source ref
 * `docs/kernel-rebuild/VAK-OIKONOMIA-KNOWLEDGE-RETURN.md#14-cs-the-actual-passage-through-paired-positions`)
 * and `docs/integrations/epi-logos/TA-ONTA-VAK-COMPOSITIONAL-EXECUTION-LOCK.md`.
 * The CS passages below are that file's `CsProfile::pairs`, transcribed
 * EXACTLY (CS0 full traverse … CS5 direct synthesis, forward-synthesis and
 * returning-inquiry directions); a drifted transcription is a contract bug
 * and the tests pin it.
 *
 * Materiality law (Vāk lock §3: "Recording these labels is not acceptance"):
 * a binding whose fields change nothing is refused here, and every field that
 * IS bound changes the traversal or the composition for real —
 *   CF  must equal the reading's WARRANTED `ql.context_frame_ref`, verbatim
 *       (no invented constitutional voice);
 *   CP  per scene is authored (Journey is the authoring instrument) and the
 *       CS passage VISITS positions — scenes at unvisited positions drop out
 *       of the traversal, so CP membership changes what plays;
 *   CS  profile + direction determine the actual hop order of the traversal;
 *   CFP thread form changes the step structure: CFP1 plays a hop's positions
 *       as one chord step; CFP2 (chained) requires the passage's `to` to
 *       hand the next hop its `from` and is refused otherwise; CFP3 appends
 *       one fused step over every visited scene; CFP4 sustains the last step
 *       (drone, with explicit stop); CFP5 (nested/canon) is refused inside a
 *       single traversal — one composition becoming a participant inside
 *       another needs the parent composition owner, not this surface;
 *   CPF participation regime governs agent operation (see ./agent): under
 *       `human-engaged` a Technē_3 proposal is marked for human acceptance;
 *   CT  gates what material a composed scene proposal must carry (./compose).
 *
 * The binding lives in the local composition draft until routed; the routed
 * input carries it verbatim (./sequence). Nothing here persists.
 *
 * Erasable TypeScript: loadable by the renderer, Vite, and `node --test`.
