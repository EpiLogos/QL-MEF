/**
 * The M3′ proving reading (issue #216) — the lane's local proving input for
 * the source-backed three-Scene walk.
 *
 * Provenance: composed from the pinned TB0 specimen
 * `fixtures/techne/tb0-connective-base-v1.json` (TB0-1, head 2c704dc) — the
 * SAME real subject, whole, warranted QL facet, temporal facets, places,
 * sources, actions and disclosure, verbatim. Two journey-scene bindings are
 * added beside the specimen's own `…/scene/crossing` binding, named in the
 * specimen's own scene-ref grammar, to give the proving walk its three
 * source-backed scenes; they are composed by this instrument's office
 * (authoring), not attributed to any native owner. TB0-1-only fields the
 * ported TS mirror does not yet carry are omitted (`agency`, relation
 * standing/relation_ref/temporal_facet_ref/evidence_refs, place
 * relation/uncertainty, temporal attempt_ref/return_ref,
 * ql.m_coordinate_ref/return_ref) — the mirror is at the T0 field set and
 * this lane does not privately fork the contract; the gap is recorded on the
 * issue. The tests ground every ref against the canonical specimen file, so
 * a drifted ref fails loudly.
 *
 * Erasable TypeScript: loadable by the renderer, Vite, and `node --test`.
