/**
 * The Journey's structured agency state (L5 Technē T5 — issue #216, §8) —
 * what `Aletheia_3 / Technē_3` can INSPECT and OPERATE.
 *
 * Law (wayfinder §16, dual-reading lock §16): each instrument publishes
 * sufficient structured state for its situated Agency to perceive — current
 * subject, active instrument/cut, selection, source/revision provenance,
 * available native Actions, current scene focus, authority and disclosure
 * limits — and Agent operation uses the SAME ActionRefs as human operation,
 * never DOM/WebGL scraping, never a private chat loop, never a hidden command
 * queue. This module is that publication for M3′: a pure, deterministic,
 * JSON-safe reading of the Journey's own state. It executes nothing; the
 * governed operations it exposes go through the same routed ActionRefs the
 * human surface uses (./sequence's reorder proposal, ./compose's composition
 * proposal) with the C0′ participation regime attached — under
 * `human-engaged` a Technē_3-proposed change is marked for human acceptance;
 * the instrument itself still writes nothing.
 *
 * Erasable TypeScript: loadable by the renderer, Vite, and `node --test`.
