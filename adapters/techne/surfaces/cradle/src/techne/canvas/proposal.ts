/**
 * The typed relation proposal path (L5 Technē M1′, QL-MEF #214) — Canvas as
 * a relation-AUTHORING surface that never mutates semantics itself.
 *
 * The law this module keeps (issue #214 §4; dual-reading lock §7):
 *   - the relation TYPE is chosen from the authority the reading actually
 *     discloses — the provider's own relation vocabulary in use on this
 *     whole. A type outside that vocabulary is carried verbatim but flagged
 *     `outside_disclosed_vocabulary` (the Research Canvas pattern of a
 *     distinguished unclassified connection that is never a factual claim);
 *     nothing here collapses relations to a generic edge type;
 *   - a proposal is a SUGGESTION with its own minted presentation ref
 *     (`ql.techne:canvas-proposal:` namespace) — never a native relation
 *     ref, never written into the reading or the whole;
 *   - endpoints must be refs the reading actually discloses: Canvas relates
 *     addressed material, it does not invent field residents;
 *   - evidence/source/standing ride the proposal exactly as the contract's
 *     relation fields name them, so a committed proposal can be judged by
 *     the owner on the same terms as a native relation;
 *   - commit ROUTES through the reading's own disclosed native Actions
 *     (`resolveActionRoute`): the receipt — routed or refused, with the
 *     owner's reason — is attached to the proposal and shown. Routing is
 *     not execution; the receipt says so;
 *   - reject touches NOTHING: no reading mutation, no session mutation, no
 *     residue. The reject-once-prove-no-mutation case is directly testable.
 *
 * Erasable TypeScript: loadable by the renderer, Vite, and `node --test`.
