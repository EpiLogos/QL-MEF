/**
 * The Canvas structured state for the situated Agencies (L5 Technē M1′,
 * QL-MEF #214) — what `Aletheia_1 / Technē_1` perceives of this instrument
 * through native refs and typed state, never screenshots or DOM
 * reconstruction (wayfinder §17; TB0 situated-Agency floor).
 *
 * One pure function, one JSON-serialisable object:
 *   - exact refs: subject, whole, reading, snapshot, selection, focus;
 *   - the current View (ref, viewport, bounds, layout basis) and its
 *     addressed refs — presentation;
 *   - the semantic relations verbatim, WITH their TB0 evidence discipline
 *     (relation_ref, standing, source, evidence, temporal qualification) —
 *     the agency sees the field's actual typed relations, not edge labels;
 *   - the open relation proposals with their statuses and receipts — so an
 *     Agency proposes/inspects through the same artifacts a person does;
 *   - the disclosed native Actions verbatim — execution always crosses the
 *     native authority seam;
 *   - the warranted QL reading (refs + warrant + geometric/refraction
 *     readings) so an Agency can explain why a layout is or is not
 *     warranted — and never assign a QL coordinate because a layout
 *     resembles one;
 *   - the situated-Agency role bindings carried verbatim from the reading
 *     (including honest absence: a reading that situates Technē_2 does not
 *     become Technē_1 just because Canvas is open);
 *   - cut disclosure, so the M1′ ↔ 3:3 crossing is available as state.
 *
 * Erasable TypeScript: loadable by the renderer, Vite, and `node --test`.
