/**
 * The World model (L5 Technē M4′ — World / Places) — pure derivation over a
 * `TechneReading` (ql.techne/v1, TB0-1): the instrument is the situated
 * whole — place, reference frame, Earth relation — of which Map, Street and
 * Globe are the concrete spatial interaction body, not the office itself
 * (`docs/L5-TECHNE-DUAL-READING-LOCK.md` §10, QL-MEF #217).
 *
 * Laws carried here:
 *   - the hard geography distinctions (OCCURRED_AT, LOCATED_IN, OPERATED_IN,
 *     TRAVELLED_TO, MYTH_LOCATED_AT) are preserved verbatim and are never
 *     interchangeable; a mythic location does not become a historical one
 *     because both can render on a map. Standing classes below exist for
 *     visual distinction only — identity and vocabulary stay the owner's;
 *   - Place identity is independent of coordinates: an unlocated place is a
 *     honest state with its identity, never a defect to fill;
 *   - time filtering constrains a Place reading without reminting identity
 *     (the filter in `./filter` owns that law; this model only reads it);
 *   - the wider reference-frame depth (M1 harmonic, M2 planetary/
 *     correspondential, M3 world-clock, M4 EarthBody/Nara) is consumed from
 *     producers and from what the reading itself carries — NEVER recomputed
 *     in renderer code. Producer depth that is not callable from this tree
 *     stays explicitly unavailable, with the reason, exactly like the TB0
 *     specimen's degraded Place facet;
 *   - privacy rides the contract's own disclosure terms (the situated-Agency
 *     roles' `privacy` fields): Nara-private state is never rendered here,
 *     only its constraint is named.
 *
 * Erasable TypeScript: loadable by the renderer, Vite, and `node --test`.
