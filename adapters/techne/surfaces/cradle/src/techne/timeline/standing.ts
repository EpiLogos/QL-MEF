/**
 * The M2′ standing grammar (QL-MEF #215) — how a relation's epistemic
 * standing becomes a VISUAL class without ever upgrading it.
 *
 * The law (#215 §5): sourced fact, source-reported claim, inferred/derived
 * relation, user-authored hypothesis, disputed relation and
 * unavailable/unknown standing must stay visually and structurally distinct,
 * and no animation, lane placement or edge strength may silently upgrade a
 * relation's standing. This module is the whole of that grammar, and it is
 * mechanical: it reads ONLY the owner-supplied fields (standing, source_ref,
 * evidence_refs, derivation_ref, origin) and maps them to a coarse visual
 * class. The owner's verbatim standing string always rides alongside and is
 * always what the surface displays — the class only chooses the stroke.
 *
 * The mapping is deliberately conservative (first match wins, never upgrades):
 *   disputed keywords          -> "disputed"
 *   mythic keywords            -> "mythic"
 *   derivation_ref present or
 *   interpretation keywords    -> "derived"   (an interpretation stays
 *                                interpreted even when it cites a source)
 *   source_ref or evidence     -> "sourced"
 *   a standing with no source  -> "authored"  (the owner's own assertion)
 *   nothing disclosed          -> "unavailable" (standing unknown — shown as
 *                                unknown, never guessed)
 *
 * Erasable TypeScript: loadable by the renderer, Vite, and `node --test`.
