/**
 * The M2′ structured state and Expression-crossing gate (QL-MEF #215 §7–§8).
 *
 * `relationFieldState` is what `Aletheia_2 / Technē_2` reads: the active
 * projection, every relation with its verbatim standing and temporal
 * qualification, the time window, the derived-vs-native identity split, the
 * reading's own disclosed Actions and Agency role bindings — all carried
 * verbatim from the reading, never reconstructed from UI text. An agency
 * operates through these refs and the disclosed Actions, never through DOM
 * scraping.
 *
 * `expressionCrossing` is the M2′ ↔ 3:3 gate. The law (#215 §7): only
 * source-backed or canonically derived relations may drive an Expression
 * profile; a temporal or causal relation does not become sonic/harmonic
 * meaning by default. The gate is mechanical and conservative — it
 * warrants the crossing ONLY when the reading's own disclosure opens the
 * 3:3 reading AND the focused relation's standing is sourced or derived.
 * Warranting the crossing asserts NOTHING about resonance, correspondence,
 * music or colour: those semantics stay with the Expression owner.
 *
 * Erasable TypeScript: loadable by the renderer, Vite, and `node --test`.
