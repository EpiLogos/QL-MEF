/**
 * The DisclosureSession store (L5 Technē T0) — the Cradle's one ephemeral
 * cross-instrument disclosure session (QL-MEF wayfinder §3–§5). One subject,
 * one source-qualified selection, one reading basis, one agent-session ref,
 * carried across instruments; each navigation hop preserves subject, source
 * basis and selection unless the person deliberately refreshed.
 *
 * This is presentation-seam state owned by the Cradle — never a canonical
 * domain object and never a second agent/session store: the agent-session
 * ref rides the selection verbatim from the owner grammar and is never
 * minted or rewritten here, and Epii co-reference keeps flowing through the
 * kernel's one GlobalFocusState (the surface binding names the subject as
 * its ref; focus.subject follows the active surface; AgentLayer reads it).
 *
 * TB0 (2026-09-16): the session derives and carries its `application_cut`
 * from the instrument (expressions ↔ 3:3-conjugate, deep instruments ↔
 * 4:2-deep) so cut crossings stay explicit and contract-agreeing; cut-level
 * hops keep every identity ref byte-exact.
 *
 * Plain observable store (subscribe/get); zero React dependency. Erasable
 * TypeScript: loadable by the renderer, Vite, and `node --test`.
