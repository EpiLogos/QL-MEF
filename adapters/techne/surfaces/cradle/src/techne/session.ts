/**
 * The DisclosureSession store (L5 Technē T0) — the Cradle's one ephemeral
 * cross-instrument disclosure session (QL-MEF wayfinder §3–§5). One subject,
 * one source-qualified selection, one reading basis, one agent-session ref,
 * carried across instruments; each navigation hop preserves subject, source
 * basis and selection unless the person deliberately refreshed.
 *
 * TB0-1 (QL-MEF #212, consumed by #219): the session carries the dual-reading
 * state — the active application cut (3:3-conjugate ↔ 4:2-deep), the situated
 * ground (whole/project/world/context-frame/occasion/Return-target/reference-
 * frame/scene-focus refs) — and exposes `crossCut`, the coordinate-preserving
 * crossing between the two readings. Crossing changes the mode of disclosure
 * and available operation, never the subject, sources, occasion, Actions or
 * Return target.
 *
 * This is presentation-seam state owned by the Cradle — never a canonical
 * domain object and never a second agent/session store: the agent-session
 * ref rides the selection verbatim from the owner grammar and is never
 * minted or rewritten here, and Epii co-reference keeps flowing through the
 * kernel's one GlobalFocusState (the surface binding names the subject as
 * its ref; focus.subject follows the active surface; AgentLayer reads it).
 *
 * Plain observable store (subscribe/get); zero React dependency. Erasable
 * TypeScript: loadable by the renderer, Vite, and `node --test`.
